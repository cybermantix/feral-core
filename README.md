# A No-Code-Low-Code solution for the misfits, the dropouts, the freaks

For the past 23 years people have asked why I code in PHP. I'll admit, back in 2000 I really wanted to code in Java, so I did. I wrote a lot of Java, PERL, Javascript, Flex, whatever was 'hot' at the time. But, time after time I kept building project in PHP. First PHP3, then PHP4, 5, 6 (just kidding), 7 and now PHP8. 

Time after time at tech conference, online, some asshole manager I was criticised for using PHP. At this point in my career I'm done with the programming language religious wars. 

So you don't think a No-Code-Low-Code system should be written in PHP?? Fine, [Piss off and Go Away](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Elitest).

NoLoCo is a No-Code-Low-Code framework written in PHP. This project is the free and open core which contains the basic tools for NoLoCo.

# NoLoCo

As you already know, NoLoCo stands for No/Low-Code and yes, it's written in PHP. Build on the incredible [Symfony](https://symfony.com/) framework. The point of NoLoCo is to make an easy to use, easy to modify No/Low-Code solution that is accessible to anybody.

## NoLoCo-Core

This project is the core code used for the processes. It contains the basics needed for the engine, the validation, and a basic set of NodeCode and CatalogNodes.

The code can be run inline with other code by executing a proceess and getting the results of the process.
